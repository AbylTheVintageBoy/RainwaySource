# RainwaySource
Use it as long as you will credit me!
This is Rainway's full src.
Just the launcher is older but it still works. Some things at the launcher do not work though so you need to modify it for your needs. If you do not know what this is, rainway is a project that revives older versions of roblox (Old Roblox Revival). If you want forums use PhpBB, thats what i used. PLEASE remember that this source is as of 8/16/2021 and it won't get updated!
Also remember, fuck codex!
